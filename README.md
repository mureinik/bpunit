## Boilerplate Utilities for JUnit

### What is BPUnit?
BPUnit (short for Boiler Plate Unit) is a set of utilities to help alleviate
the pain of boiler-plating your JUnit tests.

### Why do I need BPUnit?

> The opposite of making a mistake is testing.

  Alleh, N. (2004).

All to often you encounter a situation where some piece of the code was not
tested because "it's too simple to break", or "it's not worth the effort". More
often than not, these are the places that contain the bugs.

BPUnit attempts to fill this gap by offering a set of utilities to make testing
even these boring parts of the code as pain free as possible.
